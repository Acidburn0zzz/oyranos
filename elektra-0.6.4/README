ABOUT
=====

Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration
parameters in a hierarchical key-value pair mechanism, instead of each program
using its own text configuration files. This allows any program to read and
save its configuration with a consistent API, and allows them to be aware of
other applications' configurations, permitting easy application integration.
While architecturally similar to other OS registries, Elektra does not have
most of the problems found in those implementations.
