 *  @brief   Graph policies
 *  @internal
 *
 *  The user visible Oyranos settings are subject to be applied to graphs.
 *  This module type provides an interface to check and verified a graph
 *  according to arbitrary policies in a automated fashion. 
 *  The usage of graph policy modules is optional and
 *  can be controled by the front end function oyConversion_Correct().
 *
 *  The policy check can cover options and data checks. Graph analysis and 
 *  correction is possible as well.
 *
 *  Differences to native node modules are that, a policy module runs before
 *  the graph starts data processing, it can provide options for a group of 
 *  node modules including a UI and provide additional object types.
 *
 *  @version Oyranos: 0.1.10
