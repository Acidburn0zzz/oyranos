Overview:
    This directory contains example applications.

  oyranos_cmm_dDev.c: dummy device backend
  oyranos_cmm_dFil.c: dummy filter module
  image2pdf:      simple RAW to Cairo renderer
  image_display:  simple image viewer using Oyranos
  qcmsevents:     X11 CMS events observer (_ICC_PROFILE_xxx, _ICC_COLOR_xxx )


Dependencies:
  all:
      * installed Oyranos
  qcmsevents:
      * libXcm from Tomas Carnecky and the Xfixes extension
  image2pdf:
      * Cairo, dcraw
  image_display:
      * FLTK


Notes:
    image_display is compatible to the X Color Management spec and
    color corrects its image area itself, while remaining the widget area un
    changed. The desktop and the image_display non image area is color
    corrected by a color server under Compiz/KWin. The color server must 
    be switched on to do so. A monitor profile should be installed eigther with
    oyranos-monitor or some other tool.


Building:
    # to avoid trouble, use the Oyranos source dir "make examples" command
    $ make


Known Issues:
  qcmsevents:
    qcmsevents needs window manager supporting the extended ICCCM hint
    _NET_CLIENT_LIST. E.g. twm does not provide this information.
