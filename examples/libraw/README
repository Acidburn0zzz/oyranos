The oyranos-file app is used to render a cameraRAW file to a ppm. But
more important is the capability to embedd device calibration information 
into a provided ICC profile.

The resulting modified ICC device profile can be placed into the local or 
remote ICC device profile DB and will be automatically selected by the lraw 
rendering module.
This can be seen in Oyranos' image_display and in the lraw CinePaint plugin.
