Overview:
    This directory contains example applications.

  colour_desktop: compiz desktop colour management plug-in; use "make install"
                  to use a local copy
  dummy_device:   dummy device backend
  image2pdf:      simple RAW to Cairo renderer
  image_display:  a rudimentary ppm file displayer using Oyranos
  xcmsevents:     X11 CMS events observer (_ICC_PROFILE_xxx, _NET_COLOR_xxx )


Dependencies:
  all:
      * installed Oyranos
  colour_desktop and xcmsevents:
      * Xcolor from Tomas Carnecky and the Xfixes extension
  colour_desktop:
      * compiz-fusion
  image2pdf:
      * Cairo, dcraw
  image_display:
      * FLTK


Notes:
    colour_desktop and image_display are compatible in that image_display
    colour corrects its image area itself, while remaining the widget area un
    changed. The desktop and the image_display non image area is colour
    corrected by colour_desktop under compiz. colour_desktop must be switched
    on to do so. A monitor profile should be installed eigther with 
    oyranos-monitor or some other tool.


Building:
    # to avoid trouble, use the Oyranos source dir "make examples" command
    $ make
    $ make install   # needed for installing the compiz plug-in


Known Issues:
  xcmsevents:
    xcmsevents needs window manager supporting the extended ICCCM hint
    _NET_CLIENT_LIST. E.g. twm does not provide this information.
