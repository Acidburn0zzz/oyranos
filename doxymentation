    @section intro Introduction
  
    Oyranos is intended as a entry point for colour savy applications.
    In its current stage it configures profile paths, sets default profiles, 
    maps devices to profiles, sets a monitor profile in X and uploads a vcgt
    tag. This means for instance all applications using Oyranos will use for
    a incoming digital camera picture the same profile and watch it through the
    same monitor profile with the same options for rendering intent, simulation
    and so on.

    @section tools User Tools Documentation
    - oyranos-monitor - a commandline tool for calling from a setup script like
      .xinitrc. It selects a profile for the current monitor and sets up the
      X server at startup time. Usage:
    @verbatim
    # select a monitor profile, load the binary blob into X and fill the
    # VideoCardGammaTable, if appropriate
    oyranos-monitor
    @endverbatim
    - oyranos-policy - a tool to set a policy from a xml file. Use it like:
    @verbatim
    oyranos-policy `oyranos-config --syscolordir`/`oyranos-config --settingsdirname`/office.policy.xml
    @endverbatim
    Affected are default profiles and some behaviour settings.
    - <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Oyranos_Configuration_Dialog">oyranos-config-fltk</a> - a configuration UI application, using some functions      of the Oyranos APIs. If you have <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=ICC_Examin">ICC Examin</a> installed it can be called to
      show details of profiles. 
    - oyranos-config - a command line tool to get compiler flags to using Oyranos in your own project. Try  \i oyranos-config \i --help to see the appropriate options.

    @section user User API Documentation
    The basic Oyranos API gets included with oyranos.h. An application, which
    wants to use these functions, needs to link against Oyranos and Elektra.
    - @ref policy - load / save of user policies
    - @ref options - layout and describe options to the user; part of user policies
    - @ref behaviour - get and set common behaviour; part of user policies
    - @ref default_profiles - get and set commonly used profiles; part of user policies
    - @ref path_names  - get information about configured and used profile search paths 
    - @ref profile_lists - provides the search path content as profile lists for your GUI
    - @ref profile_handling - file I/O and more

    The monitor related API is contained in oyranos_monitor.h. Linkage on Linux
    needs X11. Therefore this library part is separated from the main one. 
    - @ref monitor_api - monitor profile configuration

    The key names, which Oyranos uses to store its configuration in an Elektra
    file tree, are defined in oyranos_definitions.h.
    \n

    More toppics about programming with Oyranos can be found on the @ref coding
    page. 

    @subsection api_tutorial Programming Tutorial
    Frist you have to put a
    @verbatim
    #include <oyranos/oyranos.h>
    int oyranos_version = oyVersion();
    @endverbatim
    in your source text, in order to use Oyranos. \b oyranos-config \b --cflags delivers the compiler flags and \b oyranos-config \b --ldflags the linker flags.

    Then you can put Oyranos functions in your code and compile with:
    @verbatim
    cc `oyranos-config --cflags` `oyranos-config --ldflags` mycode.c -o myApp
    @endverbatim
    to link Oyranos into your application.

    For C++ make shure you use the oyranos:: namespace.

/** @page concepts Concepts

    The here described concepts are targeted until version 1.0 of Oyranos.
    They are intended to make the API consistent and its usage predictable.
    A additional page shall describe the behaviour of Oyranos, default settings
    and recommendations to developers who like to interact with the system.

    @subsection os_concept Interoperatibility on Operating Systems
    - Oyranos is intended to work on Posix systems and at least Windows.
    - On Linux the <a href="http://elektra.sf.net">Elektra</a> configuration
      library is used for managing and storing the configuration.
    - If publically available, Oyranos will sit on top of native Colour
      Management Systems like ColorSync&copy; or ICM&copy;.

    @subsection path_concept Paths Configuration
    - see <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=OpenIccDirectoryProposal">OpenIccDirectoryProposal at ColourWiki</a>

    @subsection rights_concept Personality
    - Users configure their own settings, while administrators 
      configure system wide settings.
    - User settings have priority over system settings
    - All settings, called policy as a whole, shall be saveable and recoverable.

    @subsection modul_concept Extensibility
    - Register new capabilities and modules will help to build a flexible base
      for further extensions.
    - Therefore the internal data must be kept almost dynamic.
    - Functions are needed, which show useful informations for GUIs, about the
      content in the profiles and about possible errors.
    - Some descriptors are provided as strings, and may help keeping 
      the user interface consistent throughout toolkits. (translation?)

/** @page coding Coding Conventions

    @section general_c_conventions General
    Oyranos is written in C for portability. All types belonging to its API's
    are prefixed with a <b>oy</b>.\n
    Oyranos objects naming is build after C++ conventions,
    where access to a class member is prefixed with the scope operator. \n
    <i>oyranos::oyClass::oyClassFunction</i>\n
    looks in Oyranos\n
    <i>oyClass_Function</i>. Of course a function specific to a data object 
    needs the object itself as argument, as the this pointer is not available.\n
    Oyranos features a flexible memory management and allows easy integration
    with different memory management strategies.

    @section data_handling Data Handling
    <p>Oyranos uses a mix of different structures. Among them are the basic C
    types, simple C structs and Oyranos managed structs.
    The structs are transparent for compile time typechecking and easy
    debugging at runtime.</p>

    <p>Objects are transparent to allow easier debugging. But be aware to not
    change the private members of Oyranos objects directly. 
    They are marked at end with a underscore <b>_</b>. Use the appropriate 
    functions for each object instead. Otherwise the objects are in danger to
    be handled inadequately.
    </p>

    @section memory_handling Memory Handling
    - For strings, constant pointers to chars are provided whenever possible.
    - For the need of allocating unknown sizes of memory, a function is passed
      by the user doing the memory allocation. The returned memory is then to
      be managed by the user.
    - More complex library allocated memory blocks, like profile name lists,
      can be freed with a Oyranos provided function. They should be encapsulated
      into a Oyranos object.
    - Oyranos objects transport always a allocator. The allocator is possible 
      to set by the user at Object creation time.
    - Objects can contain a user specified deallocator.

    @section  naming_convention Naming Conventions
    Declaration types are distinguishable through the below described naming
    conventions.\n
    A <b>oy</b> prefix is common for all functions, types and enums to
    display a namespace in C.\n
    <b>Functions</b> words are starting upper case, (after the oy prefix)
    <i> oyVersion() </i>\n
    <b>Enums</b> have all letters  written upper case. Words are separated by
                      underscore
      <i>oyOBJECT_TYPE_e</i>\n
    <b>Variables</b> are written lower case and words are separated by underscore.
      <i>file_name</i>\n
    <b>Macros</b> are upper case and start with <b>OY_</b>:
      <i>OY_HAVE_PNG</i>\n
    As one exception some macros are normal named to allow later typing:
      <i>oyChar</i>\n
      Function alike macros are named like normal functions followed by
      a <b>_m</b>:
      <i>oyColourOffset_m()</i>\n
      For enum alike macros it is more appropriate to omit the _M suffix:
      <i>oyTYPE_123A_8</i>\n
    <b>Stucts</b> words start upper case followed by a <b>_s</b>:
      <i>oyProfile_s</i>\n
    <b>Struct/object handling functions</b> start upper case with the struct
    name, followed with the verb:
      <i>oyProfile_GetChannelName</i>\n

    @subsection  suffixes  Declaration Overview
    - <b>_t</b> types
    - <b>_s</b> structs
    - <b>_f</b> functions
    - <b>_e</b> enums
    - <b>_M</b> or <b>_m</b> or none for macro functions
    - ending underscore <b>_</b> for non editable internals
    - The namespace in C++ is <b>oyranos::</b>\n
      <i>oyranos::oyVersion()</i>


    @section development Development Conventions

    @subsection api_design API Design
    Oyranos API's handle various tasks. A important idea is to make colour 
    management easy. Thus some API's are high level and only a few calls
    are needed to do the, hopefully, right thing. For finer control
    many low level API's are exposed.\n
    It is as well possible to reimplement the Oyranos functionality. Some
    recommendations or standards are therefore provided at OpenICC. Feel free
    to contact the Oyranos project to discuss further details.\n
    Internal API's handle low level file access, internal static lists and
    adapt to backends.

    @subsection object_design Object Design
    All Oyranos structs (::oyStruct_s)have a first member called \a type_ to
    better distinguish them. The according value is available as a enum from
    ::oyOBJECT_TYPE_e.\n
    Each object should implement a appropriate oyStruct_Copy_f() and a 
    oyStruct_Release_f() function member on position 2 and 3. 
    These allow to easily cast to functions of other objects. Many object
    manipulators in Oyranos rely on this feature.
    Thus each object can implement list functionality with a common base in the
    above mentioned ::oyStructList_s. The resoning behind the above outlined use
    of common API's is, even with C casting, they help in reducing code size, 
    for easier maintaining and while fixing bugs.\n
    The fourth member of a ::oyObject_s style struct is \a oy_ and features common
    properties, like memory management, naming and more.\n
    A new simple Oyranos data data structure should contain the type_ specifier.
    Complex data structures should contain the type_ and oy_ structure to allow
    the advanced features.\n
    Providing of similiar functions for different Oyranos objects, allows
    their use in a abstract way. A soft typecheck is possible over the type_ 
    member. For an example see the internal ::oyStructList_s struct with the 
    according C API. As casting in C is always blind, it is better to avoid, 
    except you know what you do.

    @subsection api_naming API Naming
    Keeping API members in a lexical relation allowes
    for later easy searching with tools of choice. So you find rather a 
    getOyNamedColourName but oyNamedColour_GetName and can easily find the  
    related functions in the appropriate NamedColour API. The sheme follows
    C++ syntax: (namespace)oy(ranos)::(class)NamedColour::(function)getName.
    This should as well help in designing OO wrappers to allow consistency among
    C Oyranos and its wrappers for various languages.

/** @page install_current Installation

    @section install Installation
    Oyranos depends on following libraries:\n

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://elektra.sf.net">Elektra</a>, this is the configuration backend for linux, currently version 0.7 is requierd. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.fltk.org">fltk</a> version >= 1.1.4 needed for a user interface\n
    you may configure fltk with several options enabled\n
    --enable-threads is needed for threads support (in ICC Examin)\n
    --enable-xft is ok for antialiased fonts\n
    --enable-debug is generally a good choice\n
    --enable-shared is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.etg.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de/web/doe/xcalib/">Xcalib</a> for loading a given  VideoCardGammaTag from profile to a running XFree86/Xorg session (optionally)</li>
    </ul>\n
    For building unpack the tgz file and type #make; make install.\n\n
    Optionally you can specifiy an other than the default prefix /opt/local by typing:\n
    #configure.sh --prefix=/what/you/like\n
    #make\n
    #make install   (optionally)\n
