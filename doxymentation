    @section intro Indroduction
    Oyranos is intended as a entry point for colour savy applications.
    In its current stage it configures profile paths, sets default profiles, 
    mapps devices to profiles, sets a monitor profile in X and uploads a vcgt
    tag. This means for instance all applications using Oyranos will use for
    incoming digital camera picture the same profile and watch it through the
    same monitor profile.


    @section concept Concept
    The here described concepts are targeted until version 1.0 of Oyranos.
    They are intended to make the API consistent and its usage predictable.

    @subsection general_concept General
    - Users can configure their own settings, while administrators can
      configure system wide settings.

    @subsection path_concept Paths Configuration
    - Paths are scanned secursively avoiding links for security reasons.
    - Paths counts allways, to aim consistency. There are no exceptions.

    @subsection memory_concept Memory Handling
    - For strings constant pointers to chars are the prefered way (utf8?)
    - For the need of allocating unknown sizes of memory a function is passed
      by the user allocation the memory. The returned block goes into the
      responsibility of the user.
    - Library allocated memory blocks like profile lists can be freed with
      a Oyranos provided function.

    @subsection os_concept Interoperatibility on Operating Systems
    - Oyranos is intended to work on at least Linux, osX and (hopefully) Windows
    - On Linux the <a href="http://elektra.sf.net">Elektra</a> configuration
      library is used for the managing and storing configurations.
    - If publically available Oyranos will sit on top of native Colour
      Management Systems like ColorSync&copy; or ICM&copy;.

    @section proposal Open Things
    @subsection identity_proposal Profile Identity Proposal
    One major benefit if a configuration system is the ashurance to use the
    correct profiles.\n
    A recently closed flaw in the ICC spec was a missing
    identification tag inside the profile. While profiles may have varaying
    names and descriptions, the now in the ICC standard included md5 checksum
    approach fits well in the demand of easily and relyable distinguish between
    various profiles.\n
    The plan is to check or possibly recalculate the md5 sum and modify the
    profile in the header accordingly. This makes sense especially for older
    profiles. This feature makes of course only sense of the file access is
    resonably quick. A hash table may help here.\n
    Some tests are needed befor implementing the described method in Oyranos.\n
    @subsection correlation_proposal Correlation Proposal
    An other toppic is the correlation of device and program settings during
    image production and the selection of the correct profile for the needed
    conversions. The profile should allways fit to the tool chain used. 
    My suggestion is here to embedd these settings in a easy recoverable
    way into the profile. A special ascii tag could be used therefor.\n
    External libraries like sane or cups should tell Oyranos theyre
    settings and query for a suitable profile. In the case of a not finding a
    fitting profile the external library may ask for an alternative list of
    settings. With selecting the desired settings the profile can be selected.
    The goal herein is to give the user the freedom of choice and the security
    regarding quality.

 
    @section install Installation
    Oyranos depends on following libraries:<br>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://elektra.sf.net">Elektra</a>, this is the configuration backend for linux , <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117521">version 0.4.8</a> should suffice . This version has the least amount of dependencies.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.osc.edu/~jbryan/FLU">FLU</a> version >= 2.14 
   for a convenient file browser (optionally, should be installed to play with Oyranos)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.fltk.org">fltk</a> version >= 1.1.4 needed by FLU<br>
    you may configure fltk with several options enabled<br>
    --enable-threads is needed for threads support (in ICC Examin)<br>
    --enable-xft is ok for antialiased fonts<br>
    --enable-debug is generally a good choice<br>
    --enable-shared is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.etg.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de/web/doe/xcalib/">Xcalib</a> for loading a given  VideoCardGammaTag from profile to a running XFree86/Xorg session (optionally)</li>
    </ul><br>
    For building unpack the tgz file and type #make; make install.<br><br>
    Optionally you can specifiy an other than the default prefix /opt/local by typing:<br>
    #configure.sh --prefix /what/you/like<br>
    #make<br>
    #make install   (optionally)<br>
 
    <br>
