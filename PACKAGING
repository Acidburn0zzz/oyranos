Components


Default ICC Profiles
Make shure the base and printing profiles are in place. The policy files in the settings directory and many other parts rely on them. These settings files are essential to Oyranos. OpenICC-data ICC profiles is a must for Oyranos.



Libraries
Do not omit the provided libraries for distribution. You can consider splitting it out into a separate package. The libraries contain essential functionality.

The libXNVCtrl is not a must.

Do not try to install the included Elektra. It is modified and not for 
placing in public places except liboyranos_elektra.xxx.


GUI
oyranos-config-fltk is, as long as no other colour management panel is
available, a essential part.


Sources
Some files contain non stable API's. E.g. oyranos_alpha.h is marked
as in alpha stage.


Licenses
Oyranos covers pices with different licenses.
Read the first part of the COPYING file carefully. 


Documentation
The Doxyfile_intern is for Oyranos developers, not for public installation.


Dependencies
Can be found in README.
