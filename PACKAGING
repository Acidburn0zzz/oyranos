Components


Standard profiles
Make shure the base and ECI profiles are in place. The files in the settings directory rely on them. These settings files are essential to Oyranos.


Libraries
Do not omit the provided libraries for distribution. You can consider splitting it out into a separate package. The libraries contain essential functionality.

The libXNVCtrl is not a must.

Do not try to install the included Elektra. It is modified and not for 
placing in public places except liboyranos_elektra.xxx.


GUI
oyranos-config-fltk is, as long as no other colour management panel is
available, a essential part.


Sources
Place only the intended header files into the public include directory.
Some files contain non stable API's. As an exception oyranos_alpha.h is marked
as in alpha stage.


Licenses
Oyranos covers pices with different licenses.
Read the first part of the COPYING file carefully. 


Documentation
The Doxyfile_intern is for Oyranos developers, not for public installation.


Dependencies
Can be found in README.
