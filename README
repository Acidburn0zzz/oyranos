1. Dependencies
LibRaw and libexiv2-dev are needed.
LibRaw only provides a Makefile, you need to edit the first few lines (http://www.libraw.org/).

2. Compilation
Just edit lines 3,4 of CMakeLists.txt to point to where LibRaw is installed.
Then:
$ cmake .
$ make

3. Usage
$ ./raw2tiff <raw image>

Exif data is saved in file exif.txt

4. TODO
Use libtiff library to save the RGB buffer as a tiff image with
embeded icc profile.
