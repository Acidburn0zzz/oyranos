1. Dependencies
   * LibRaw: Only provides a Makefile, you need to edit the first few lines (http://www.libraw.org/data/LibRaw-Lite-0.7.2.tar.gz).
   * Oyranos from git: oyranos-config should be in the PATH.
   * sane-backends from git://git.debian.org/sane/sane-backends.git.
   * Your distribution's EXIV2 library (libexiv2-dev on Ubuntu).
   * (Optional) elinks to create the help text from html.

2. Compilation
   * Edit LIBRAW_L_INCLUDE_DIR, LIBRAW_L_LIBRARY_DIR of CMakeLists.txt
     to point to where LibRaw is installed.
   * To enable the pnm backend with colour labeled options:
     -  Apply the sane_cap_colour.patch to sane-backends.
     -  Run the configure script with --enable-pnm-backend.
     -  Re-build/install sane-backends.
     -  Edit </sane/install/path>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf and uncomment the pnm backend.
     -  Copy a ppm file to /tmp/input.ppm.
   * Optionally, if you want to make SANE start up much faster, edit the dll.conf
     file and keep only the lines with the backends you require.

Then:
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</your/install/path>
$ make
$ make install

3. Usage
$ ./raw2tiff <raw image> [-i <icc_profile>]
$ ./scan [-d <device>] [-i [icc profile]] [-p]
-d: use specified device, as returned by running 'scan' without arguments
-p: print out mode, do not scan/save an image.
-i: embed this icc profile to saved image.
