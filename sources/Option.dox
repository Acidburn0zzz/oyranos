 *  
    @todo include the oyOptions_t_ type for gui elements
    should be used in a list oyColourTransformOptions_s to form a options set
    oyOptions_t_ covers as well the UI part which should be separated as of the
    SimpleToolkitAbstraction project:
    http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=XML_Plug-in_options
    As of this architecture change The UI part must be decided to obtain a
    place. Probably in oyOptions_s?
    Thus the oyOption_s::name member should be removed.

 *  The id field maps to a oyWidget_s object.
 *  Options and widgets are to be queried by the according function / CMM
 *  combination.
