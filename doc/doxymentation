    @section intro Introduction
  
    Oyranos is intended as a entry point for colour savy applications.
    In its current stage it configures profile paths, sets default profiles, 
    maps devices to profiles, sets a monitor profile in X and uploads a vcgt
    tag. This means for instance all applications using Oyranos will use for
    a incoming digital camera picture the same profile and watch it through the
    same monitor profile with the same options for rendering intent, simulation
    and so on.

    @section tools User Tools Documentation
    - oyranos-monitor - a commandline tool for calling from a setup script like
      .xinitrc. It selects a profile for the current monitor and sets up the
      X server at startup time. Usage:
    @verbatim
    # select a monitor profile, load the binary blob into X and fill the
    # VideoCardGammaTable, if appropriate
    oyranos-monitor
    @endverbatim
    - oyranos-policy - a tool to set a policy from a xml file. Use it like:
    @verbatim
    oyranos-policy `oyranos-config --syscolordir`/`oyranos-config --settingsdirname`/office.policy.xml
    @endverbatim
    Affected are default profiles and some behaviour settings.
    - <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Oyranos_Configuration_Dialog">oyranos-config-fltk</a> - a configuration UI application, using some functions      of the Oyranos APIs. If you have <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=ICC_Examin">ICC Examin</a> installed it can be called to
      show details of profiles. 
    - oyranos-config - a command line tool to get compiler flags to using Oyranos in your own project. Try  \a oyranos-config \a --help to see the appropriate options.

    @section user User API Documentation
    The basic Oyranos API gets included with oyranos.h. An application, which
    wants to use these functions, needs to link against Oyranos.
    - @ref defaults_apis obtain and manipulate user preferences and UI translations
    - @ref objects_profile - select, read, manipulate and write ICC Profiles 
    - @ref devices_handling - select, read, manipulate and write colour Device Configurations
    - @ref objects_image - image data objects
    - @ref objects_conversion - build and process image graphs

    The monitor related API is contained in alpha/oyranos_alpha.h. Loading of
    the according module for the X11 libraries on Linux is done on runtime.

    The key names, which Oyranos uses to store its configuration in an Elektra
    file tree, are defined in oyranos_definitions.h.

    More in depth topics about programming with Oyranos can be found on the
    @ref coding page. 

    @subsection api_tutorial Programming Tutorial
    Frist you have to put a
    @verbatim
    #include <oyranos.h> @endverbatim
    in your source text, in order to use Oyranos. 
    @verbatim
    int main( int argc, char ** argv ) {
      int oyranos_version = oyVersion( 0 );
      return 0;
    }@endverbatim
    \b oyranos-config \b --cflags delivers the compiler flags and \b oyranos-config \b --ldflags the linker flags.

    Then you can put Oyranos functions in your code and compile with:
    @verbatim
    cc `oyranos-config --cflags --ldflags` mycode.c -o myApp @endverbatim
    to link Oyranos into your application.

    Writing of filters and modules for Oyranos is covered in the @ref
    extending_oyranos page.
